\f0\fs24 \cf0 In module 1 we were introduced to some of the basic concepts of Computer Vision, including putting together a historical timeline and exploring what real world applications of this technology might be in practice. Having just taken the History of AI introductory course, it was useful to revisit some of the key players and technologies that I was already familiar with and recontextualize that information so I could understand where they fit into the field of Computer Vision. I found the lab particularly interesting as well, because it led me to research how AI is being used as assistive technology, which I find very interesting as someone who is particularly interested in assistive technology, disability activism and how AI can be used to improve the quality of life of those who truly need it. }
