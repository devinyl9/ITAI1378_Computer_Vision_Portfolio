\f0\fs24 \cf0 The group assignment we completed for Module 4 was an introduction to image processing, a fundamental aspect of Computer Vision. Our group worked specifically to learn more about types of images formats, what their differences are and why they might be chosen for a particular task. This assignment also allowed me to show my creative side, which I don\'92t often get a chance to as an applied science major.}
