\f0\fs24 \cf0 The lab we completed for Module 5 helped to introduce us to machine learning in relation to computer vision. This was the first lab during which we trained a specific model with specific data to get an output. It walked us through the process and allowed us to observe a model without having to do much with the code. This was also the very first time I manipulated machine learning code.}
