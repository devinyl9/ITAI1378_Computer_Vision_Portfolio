\f0\fs24 \cf0 Module 6 introduced us to the basics of Neural Networks. The lab component of this module was the first version of the Chihuahua or Muffin lab, which challenged us with bits of missing code that needed to be filled in. In combination with our group assignment, which was observing changing the hyper parameters inside of tensor flow playground, I walked away from this module with a much more comprehensive understanding of neural networks and the code that implements them.}
