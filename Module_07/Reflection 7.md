\f0\fs24 \cf0 The group assignment and lab in Module 7 focused on expanding our knowledge of neural networks, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs. The lab was the second version of the Chihuahua vs Muffin lab, which gave valuable insight into the difference between the SVM model we used in the previous lab and the CNN used in this lab. For our group assignment we worked to manually convolve a simple image. This required a lot of research on my part, because I found the concept very difficult to understand at first. By the end of the assignment I did feel I understood the process of manually convolving an image with different filters. }
