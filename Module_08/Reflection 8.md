\f0\fs24 \cf0 Module 8 elaborated on CNN basic architecture, transfer learning and object detection. Our group assignment was to fit as much information about object detection as possible on a single sheet of paper. This was challenging because it required comprehension of the subjects we were writing about in order to convey as much information as possible in a succinct way. It turned in to a useful resource that I could see myself using in the future. }
