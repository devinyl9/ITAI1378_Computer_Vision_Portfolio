\f0\fs24 \cf0 Module 9 introduced us to the practical side of object detection. This lab aimed to demonstrate the process of loading an existing dataset comprised of images and using a pre-trained model to name and locate the objects in the images. Although I was able to get the model running, I was unable to adjust the hyper parameters to improve its performance. Although I was frustrated with my lack of technical ability, I probably learned more from this lab where I \'93failed\'94 than in any lab where was very \'93successful.\'94}
